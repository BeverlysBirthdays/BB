				<li>Joy: "There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward."</li>
				<li>Compassion: "If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion."</li>
				<li>Purpose: "A life without cause is a life without effect."</li>
				<li>Cheer: "The best way to spread cheer is to smile from ear to ear."</li>
			</ul>
